window priority:
- filter
    -> bundles, include assets, types[source, prefabs, textures, audio], hidden assets
    -> filter popup
    -> filter data

- node window
    -> base node drawing
    -> draw asset bundle data
    -> draw dependency
    -> implement positioning
    -> zoom


- future stuff
    -> dynamic ui with min and max size
    -> anchor points with other elements
